### Working w/ Chad 💻

- Created date: February 2021
- Status: work in progress

#### About me

- Work hours for me are typically 7:30AM - 4:30PM PST, and sometimes in the evenings.
- Family: wife Renee, son Finn (b.2016), daughter Olive (b.2018), two cats Leo and Umbraco.
- I value honesty, accountability, collaboration, transparency, efficiency, and humility. Call me out if I miss the mark on these!
- I am passionate about accessibility, design systems, and user experience.

#### Guiding principals

- Assume good intent. This becomes harder to do when on a remote team across time zones.
- [Disagree and commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit).
- Emphasis on output, not hours of input/ # of activities.

#### If you're on my team (this is not in any particular order)

- Due to the distributed nature of our team, the pandemic, and each individuals' needs **consider all communications as async**. We all manage our working hours individually and they may not always overlap across the team. Any email, Teams message, or work item update does **not have to be responded to outside of your working hours**. If possible, consider sending emails with a [delay delivery](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/delay-or-schedule-sending-email-messages-026af69f-c287-490a-a72f-6c65793744ba).

- Make sure to make room for personal time. It is easy to forget to take time off for yourself. It's important to take time away from work and go offline. Don't worry, there will be plenty when you return.

- Many conversations or emails should be the genesis of documentation. Move the updated requirements out of a Teams message, the process update out of a meeting discussion, and the project details out of email.

- Documentations fosters transparency and easily allows information to be shared and collaborated on. The documentation is "living" meaning it's always editable and not "done".

- Centralize the documentation in our wiki, but feel free to link to any other related artifact (Figma, Word doc, etc.) Consider a Word doc when collaborative editing or rich formatting is desired.

- Ask "why". I may be stuck in my ways or not aware of another perspective. If you see room for improvement, let me know.

- Celebrate our wins! We work hard and it takes a lot to ship something. When we do, let's share it with the team and discuss what went well.

- Schedule meetings with an agenda, leave meetings with owners or documentation. An agenda forces pointed conversations in the meeting rather than undirected conversations. Leave with documented outcomes for future reference or for anyone who was unable to attend.

<!--
-  No same day meetings.
- I trust your time management.
- If you are feeling overwhelmed, reach out.
- Own your code reviews. It's a great way to learn and share among the team.
- I’m always learning and encourage you to share feedback with me in areas I can improve.
- Work breakdowns are super important and valuable -- understand scope, share the project with the team, and allow us to more accurately share timelines.
- Everything is negotiable -- reach out if we need to reassess scope.
- 1:1 time is yours.
- Transparency: calendar is open and ask anything
- nohello
